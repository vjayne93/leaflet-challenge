# leaflet-challenge
To comlplete this challenge, I used the [USGS Earthquake Hazards Program](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) database to access information about major earthquakes in the past 30 days. I mapped these earthquakes over a street map from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org).

In the second, optional, portion of this challenge, I added tectonic plate information obtained from the [Fraxen/tectonicplates](https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates/tree/master/GeoJSON) GitHub repository. I also added a map toggle to the [OpenStreetMap Humanitarian Map](https://www.hotosm.org), which includes information about the location of refugee camps, healthcare facilities, and emergency shelters. This map could be used to identify humanitarian needs and resources in the vicinity of an earthquake. 

I used the resources linked above, [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com), and the XPert Learning Assistant in the completion of this challenge.
